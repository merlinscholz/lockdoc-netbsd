 * mcount is called on entry to each function compiled with the profiling

 * taken care of by the MCOUNT definition in <machine/profile.h>.
 *
 * _mcount updates data structures that represent traversals of the
 * program's call graph edges.  frompc and selfpc are the return
 * address and function address that represents the given call graph edge.

 * Note: the original BSD code used the same variable (frompcindex) for
 * both frompcindex and frompc.  Any reasonable, modern compiler will
